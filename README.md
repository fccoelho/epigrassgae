Epigrass Web platform
=====================

The Epigrass web platform is an online platoform for sharing Epigrass based models and its simulation results.

The models need to be built and simulated in Epigrass, and then uploaded to the site.

What is Epigrass?
---------------------
It is a free software project for the simulation of geo-referenced network models.

Why use Epigrass?
------------------------------------
It is an easy to use, mathematical modeling framework, which enables you to quickly write complex network models, metapopulation models or simply an ensemble of similar models for statistical purposes.

You can localize your model to any geographical area you desire, as long as you have a shapefile for it. You can write your own models in any language, or use the builtin epidemiological models.
Epigrass runs your models in parallel to take full advantage of your multi-core workstation.

Epigrass saves the results of your simulations to MySQL, Sqlite, CSV, as well as Shapefiles, GeoJSON and KML.
